                This uses interactive slideshow to highlight effect of COVID-19 on US mobility. The mobility data is based on location data as reported by mobile devices. The data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify any individual.

                The mobility is defined by a "mobility index" that indicates the change in mobility from the "normal" mobility before the onset of the virus. This allows to better compare and identify the impact of the virus in different US states.
                
                We begin with an overview that shows the overall mobility index for US for the last few months, and along with that the overall number of cases.
                
                Next, we investigate the state-level mobility data and co-relation with number of COVID cases in the state.
                
                Finally, we will drill down to county-specific data for each state.
